        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            Your privacy is important to GBC Bids, a business organised under the Canada Business Corporations Act. Along with our services,
            which are further defined on the Website and in our Terms and Conditions (the "Services"), we provide the auction website www.gbcbids.com (the "Website").
            This privacy statement explains how we obtain, maintain, utilize, and disclose Personal Information (as defined in the section below under "Collection of Information")
            from and about users of the Website and Services, such as bidders, buyers, and sellers of items up for auction. The privacy practises of any third parties are not covered
            by this privacy statement (such as third-party sellers through the Website). See their privacy policies to learn more about the privacy practises of third parties.

        <h2>Age Restriction</h2>
        <p>
            The Website is not intended for users under the age of 18, and you must be at least 18 years old to access the Services. Visitors under the age of 18 are not knowingly solicited for their personal information by us. If we actually learn that we have been given a child's personal information under 18, we shall take all commercially reasonable steps to have it removed from our systems as quickly as we can. Please email us at privacy@maxsold.com and provide us with any information we may need to identify the Personal Information that should be destroyed if you think we might hold any information about a child under the age of 18.
        </p>
        <h2>A Note to Visitors or Users Outside of Canada.</h2>
        <p>
            If the person is in Canada, this Privacy Policy also applies to anybody visiting the Website or taking part in the listing, management, and fulfilment of any transaction done through it. You understand and agree that we may treat your Personal Information for the reasons outlined in this Privacy Policy by using the Website and providing us with data. Moreover, your personal information may be handled outside of Canada, where the regulations governing its processing may be less strict (or stricter) than those in Canada.
        </p>
        <h2>Consent</h2>
        <p>You agree to the use of your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy by using the Website or our Services. Your Personal Information will not be used for any other reason besides those specified in this Privacy Policy without your permission. We particularly promise not to intentionally gather Personal Information for the aim of identifying you when we publicly offer our services. To put it another way, we don't market customer lists. Except in certain circumstances, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time for us to process your personal information (e.g. we may continue processing your Personal Information if required to do so pursuant to applicable law, it is relevant to our exercising any legal right or remedy, it is reasonably necessary to process any Services received by you, or it is backed up by us pursuant to any document retention, business continuity or other similar policy adopted by us). However, giving your consent back may, among other things, prevent you from using the Website and/or the Services going forward.</p>
        <h2>Information we collect</h2>
        <p>Only the Personal Information necessary for us to manage your account with us, to provide the Services, to maintain our customer/visitor lists, to answer your questions or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes, for service improvement and for other lawful business purposes, will be collected, used, and disclosed. We will take commercially reasonable precautions to guard against loss, theft, and unauthorised access, acquisition, disclosure, or use of personal information.</p>
        <h2>How we use your information</h2>
        <p>We may use your information to provide you with products or services that you request, to communicate with you about your account, to improve our website and services, and to comply with legal obligations.</p>
        <h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
        <p>We may disclose your information to third-party service providers who help us with our business operations, such as payment processing and website hosting. We may also disclose your information to comply with legal obligations or protect our rights.</p>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or use. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on our website.</p>
